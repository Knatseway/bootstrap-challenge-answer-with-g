<!--</body>-->
<!--</html>-->

<!--1st looke a mockup and break down the solid idea of what you want to accomplish and attacking piece by piece-->
<!--need a full screen navbar-->
<!--jumbotron with big leadin text-->
<!--grey area with image and 2 paragraphs-->
<!--a card with an image atached with its body-->

<!--look at desktop mockup-->
<!--similar need a container-->
<!--navbar with title and 4 links-->
<!--jumbotron same as smaller mobile images-->
<!--cards 4 across in ful screen view-->

<!--start on navbar-->
<!--then hero section-->
<!--and down the page-->

<!--create an index.html-->
<!--add to git-->
<!--add style.css-->
<!--set up page on the html page-->
<!--some of the set up was done yesterday so ddc notes and get some of the set up from bootstrap snap challenge-->
<!--He highlighted meta viewport section through the lilnk through line 8-->
<!--then script tags around line 13 and put them in bottom of body tag-->
<!--the body area-->
<!--first pic taken here-->

<!--in the body area .containertab makes the div class container tab-->

<!--Navigation bar first-->
<!--goto bs.com documentation find navbar not the full kitchen sing-->
<!--he needed the one with the four links on the right so he chose the one with 4 links-->

<!--He could use some SVG and add an icon but not yet for now he will choose to type in the word title on line 15-->
<!--lines 21 22 23 and 24 are the link lines-->

<!--span is for an inline element really good for adding specific info or rules for a specific chunk of text-->
<!--another pic here for span question-->

<!--if you feel code is getting ugly then choose shift shift and choose reformat code and it willclean up your code-->

<!--another thing when we get closer to react you will see that each attribute gets its ow line especially when there is a lot of stuff going on this is a good idea-->
<!-- and notice the closing tag is on 24 instead of 23-->
<!--    pic of sample here-->

<!--I can cal the links anything but for now we will call them 1,2,3 and 4-->
<!--The active link in a wireframe has a highlight attribute-->


<!--IN browser inspect and sources and .js-->

<!--nav bar needs to move links to the right-->
<!--ml-auto on the navbar class-->
<!--he could play with this in the devtools too-->
<!--he used ml auto to force the buttons onto the right of the page-->
<!--auto margins in bootstrap took links from left to right-->
<!--this is in the flex  under utilities-->
<!--bootstrap is built on flexbox  side note-->
<!--G looked at the dev tools in elements under ml auto mx auto margin left he sees that flex is already there-->
<!--question could you use justify? or is that superfoulous? G would come to the devtools to see if the flex is being displayed  first-->
<!--if it is not working look at devtools and in the parent element is displaying lex-->

<!--a nice thing about front end is you can experiment with the mx and mr elements-->

<!--we got the links to the right now we want to work on rounded corners-->
<!--google search how to tound hnavbar corners in bootstrap-->
<!--nothing good here so we go straight to the documentation on bootstrap-->
<!--search borders-->
<!--we are focused on border radius and adding rounded-->
<!--we open devtools elements events listeners go into body and expand the-->
<!--we added rounded in thenav class navbar-expand lg line-->
<!-- we darkened it to see shape-->

<!--next we go to border color and border border secondary in bootstrap-->
<!--we get rid of background light-->
<!--add the border-->

<!--go back to container up top and chek styles in divtools-->
<!--he is now clicking some of the checkmarks on the left of the code to see what happens if he turns on or off the elements-->

<!--getting ideas he was playing padding left and right-->
<!--now ading padding x-0in the container px-sm-3 ==$0-->
<!--ended with md-3-->

<!--G copied over the devtools changes to his code but was not satisfied.  he made a typeo and found it quickly then sitll was not saisfied.-->
<!--we went to responsive breakpoints in bs-->
<!--changed container  to container-md px-0-->
<!--if you want to change to a differnt background color thatn bs has then you can do more advanced css.-->
<!--primary is blue in bs it is a twitter company-->

<!--G was playing with settig a break point that div was set for the navbar so he will create a ew container-->

<!--Next is jumbotron-->
<!--he added the spacer in the container py-4-->

<!--went to bs for jumbotron code-->
<!--pasted it-->
<!--got rid of the text line with the paragraph-->
<!-- leaves the my-4 amrgin in-->
<!--then takes it out fully the whole line of my-4-->
<!--play with margin before calling it complete-->
<!--change container to md px-0-->
<!--decided to look back at the final completion looks good as of now-->

<!--jumbotron done-->

<!--next tackle image and two paragraphs section below jumbotron-->
<!--changed the jumbotron container to section-->
<!--he does not want to put a container on the current section because it will align to the left marin above-->

<!--so we use section class="bg-secondary" on line 47-->
<!--then-->
<!--.container>.row>.col*2 in emmet  container with child of row and child of 2 collumns-->

<!--58  col-md-3-->
<!--59 col -md-9    use these to add to 12 the magic number-->

<!--USE RULE OF 12-->
<!--needed mx auto to make the img and the text line up s the mockup-->

<!--next section-->
<!--tempted to use cards but buyer beware they are finik-->
<!--not using today-->
<!-- we will build our own cards with image and boxes-->

<!--We first used emmit but backed out to use the individual space one at at time-->
<!--for text  fillerama-->

                    Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Perhaps,
                    but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Man, I'm
                    sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.
